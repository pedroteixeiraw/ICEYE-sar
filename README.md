## SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar)

> From Tom Eager, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwyldSNlefk&ab_channel=ICEYE

Synthetic aperture radar is an imaging technique that uses radar pulses to image through clouds. SAR can also image through darkness we do not need reflected sunlight.

We are going to use radar pulses to image the ground. We send discrete pulses of radar to the ground and we measure the range to the ground and the strength of the echo.

When the pulse hits the ground, it reflects in many directions the part that comes back to the antenna is called the back scatter and if the back scatter is strong that's a bright pixel if it's weak that's a dark pixel.
